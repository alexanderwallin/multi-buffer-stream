# multi-buffer-stream

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-deprecated-red.svg)

MultiBufferStream is a wrapper holding several ArrayBuffers, but treated as a single stream.

This module simply combines [kig/DataStream.js](https://github.com/kig/DataStream.js) and the [MultiBufferStream](https://github.com/gpac/mp4box.js/blob/master/src/buffer.js) object from [gpac/mp4box.js](https://github.com/gpac/mp4box.js). It is not intended to be maintained or published on npm.
